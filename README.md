##  About the project 

We have 4 Pages, One page have some links with car name and this link redirect you to another page that show specific details about the car.

## Behind the scenes

This is simple and effective, using Routing in react i can fetch from API just a one thing that a i need like a car page details, if you click on a link just the car data is fetched from the API.

> I used json-server to simulate the API he is the **server.json** file
